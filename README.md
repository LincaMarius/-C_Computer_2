# µC Computer 2
This is a project where I want to make a modular computer where each module is made using a microcontroller. Communication between modules will be done using Serial and Parallel Bus.

µC Computer means "micro Controller Computer"

The block diagram of µC Computer 2 is as follows:

Communication between modules is done using Parallel Bus or Serial Bus such as I2C or SPI.
